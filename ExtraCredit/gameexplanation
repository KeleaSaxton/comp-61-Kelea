Game Concept: Space Invaders Extended
Space Invaders Extended is an arcade-style shooter game where players control a spaceship and defend Earth from waves of incoming alien enemies. The player can move left and right along the bottom of the screen and shoot bullets to destroy enemies. The game introduces new features including a high score tracker, a game timer, and a limited number of lives to make the experience more challenging and rewarding. As time progresses, enemies move faster and become harder to avoid. The player can restart the game after losing, encouraging longer play sessions and skill improvement.

How to Play:
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship.

Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the alien enemies.

Each enemy destroyed earns points — your high score is tracked on the screen.

The player starts with 3 lives; if enemies reach the bottom, a life is lost.

When all lives are gone, the game ends and a "Game Over" message appears.

Press R to restart a new round without resetting the high score.

The longer you survive, the faster the enemies become — keep fighting and aim for the highest score possible!
