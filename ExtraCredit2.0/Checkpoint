Game Overview
Game Title: Color Catchers
Game Summary: Color Catchers is suited for all ages. The game can last as long as the player desires with a restart button and the high score included within the game. This game is very similar to most arcade games where the user has control over a paddle and attempts to catch colored shapes as they fall down the screen. Red circles increase your score while blue circles decrease the life of the player. As the game progresses the game increases in difficulty and the shapes start falling faster. The importance of increasing the difficuly is so the player does not get bored and the game can become more challening.
